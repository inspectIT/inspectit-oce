inspectIT OpenCensus Edition is a Java agent that provides the automatic collection of metrics and traces using OpenCensus standard.
Using Java Instrumentation API, the inspectIT OCE agent is capable to instrument any JVM-based application with a zero-configuration approach.
It overcomes the problem of instrumentation libraries like OpenCensus that require you to manually instrument your application and change the source code.
