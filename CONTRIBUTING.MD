##IDE
We recommend using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) as IDE for contributing. We also recommend installing the Gradle Plugin and the [Save Actions Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7642-save-actions).
After installing IntelliJ you can just import the root folder of this repository as a Gradle project. When using the Save Actions Plugin you in addition should to copy the *saveactions_settings.xml* from the *config/ide/intellij/* directory to the .idea folder which is generated on project import.
