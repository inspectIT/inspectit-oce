=== Externalized Configuration Methods

In order to support the externalized configuration inspectIT OCE provides several methods.
These methods represent a bridge between certain configuration provider and the inspectIT OCE agent.
In this way, a configuration can be provided from different sources, for example, file systems, the internet, external services, configuration services, vaults, etc.

The configuration method is considered dynamic if it supports run-time updates.
For example, if the configuration file changes on disk, the file-based configuration method will report the updated properties to the inspectIT OCE agent.
The agent will then update the internal configuration, effectively changing the behavior of the agent during the run-time.

WARNING: Note that not all inspectIT OCE configuration properties support dynamic updates. In addition, the Java System properties and OS environment variables always have higher priority, thus dynamically changing the property that is also defined in those sources will have no effect.

All externalized configuration methods must be enabled using Java System properties or OS environment variables, as they are disabled by default.
You can have more than one method active at the same time, thus pulling the configuration from different sources.

==== File-based Configuration

The file-based configuration loads all ```.yaml```/```.yml``` and ```.properties``` files in alphabetical order from the given directory path in non-recursive mode.
The alphabetical order of files defines their priority, thus if the same property exists in `my.properties` and `yours.properties` files, then the one from the `my.properties` file will be used.

The file-based configuration is activated by specifying the existing directory path in the `inspectit.config.file-based.path` property.
It automatically watches for changes in the given directory and reports updates to inspectIT OCE agent.
If you would like to disable the dynamic updates you can set the `inspectit.config.file-based.watch` property to `false`.

.Properties related to the file-based configuration method
|===
|Property |Default| Description
|```inspectit.config.file-based.path```
|
|The path to the directory to scan for configuration files. An existing directory must be specified for the file-based configuration to be enabled.
|```inspectit.config.file-based.enabled```
|`true`
|Can be used to disable the file-based configuration while the path is still specified.
|```inspectit.config.file-based.watch```
|`true`
|If `true` the directory will be watched for changes. When changes occur, the configuration is dynamically updated.
