=== Configuration Basics

inspectIT OCE tries to implement the zero-configuration approach but lets you externalize the configuration and influence every bit of its configuration if this is required.
Internally it uses the Spring-based `PropertySource` order to allow overriding of configuration values.
Configuration properties are considered in inspectIT OCE in the following order:

. <<Java System properties,Java System properties>>
. <<OS Environment Variables,OS environment variables>>
. Supported <<Externalized Configuration Methods,externalized configuration methods>>
.. <<File-based Configuration,File-based configuration>>
. <<All Configuration Options,inspectIT OCE defaults>>

When an invalid configuration is given to inspectIT on startup, the agent will use a fallback configuration.
In this fallback configuration, the agent is inactive with the exception of listening for configuration updates.

When giving an invalid configuration through a runtime update to the agent, the agent will simply retain the previous configuration.

The overview of all available inspectIT OCE configuration properties is given in the <<All Configuration Options>> section.

==== Java System Properties

You can pass any configuration property as the Java System property to the Java command that you use to start your Java application.
For example, to override the service name used to identify your application reporting the performance data, you can change the `inspectit.service-name` property:

[subs=attributes+]
```bash
$ java -Dinspectit.service-name="My Custom Service" -javaagent:/path/to/inspectit-oce-agent-{inspectit-oce-version}.jar -jar my-java-program.jar
```

==== OS Environment Variables

Similar to the Java System properties, inspectIT OCE will also consider all the available operating system environment variables.
Due to the relaxed bindings, you can use upper case format, which is recommended when using system environment variables.

[subs=attributes+]
```bash
$ INSPECTIT_SERVICE_NAME="My Custom Service" java -javaagent:/path/to/inspectit-oce-agent-{inspectit-oce-version}.jar -jar my-java-program.jar
```

==== Relaxed Bindings

Note that due to the Spring-powered configuration approach, the inspectIT OCE agent uses Spring support for relaxed bindings.
This means that a property can be specified in different formats depending on the property source.
As suggested by Spring, the allowed formats are:

[cols="2,3",options="header"]
.Relaxed binding options for properties
|===
|Property |Note
|```inspectit.service-name```
|kebab-case, which is recommended for use in .properties and .yml files.
|```inspectit.serviceName```
|Standard camelCase syntax.
|```inspectit.service_name```
|Underscore notation (snake_case), which is an alternative format for use in .properties and .yml files.
|```INSPECTIT_SERVICE_NAME```
|UPPER_CASE format, which is recommended when using system environment variables.
|===

The formats should be used in the following way, based on the type of property source:

[cols="2,3",options="header"]
.Relaxed binding rules
|===
|Property Source |Format
|System properties
|Camel case, kebab case, or underscore notation
|Environment Variables
|Upper case format with the underscore as the delimiter.
|Property files (```.properties```)
|Camel case, kebab case, or underscore notation
|YAML files (```.yaml```, ```.yml```)
|Camel case, kebab case, or underscore notation
