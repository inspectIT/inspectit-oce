# Contributing

## IDE

We recommend using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) as IDE for contributing.

We also recommend installing the **Gradle Plugin**, the **[Save Actions Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7642-save-actions)** and the **[Lombok Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok-plugin)** for IntelliJ.

After installing IntelliJ you can import the root folder of this repository as a Gradle project. 
When using the Save Actions Plugin, you have to copy the *saveactions_settings.xml* from the `/codequality/idea` to the  `.idea` directory which is generated on project import.

Furthermore, please import the `/codequality/idea/saveactions_settings.xml` file into the project's settings of IntelliJ in order to match the code style we're using.
