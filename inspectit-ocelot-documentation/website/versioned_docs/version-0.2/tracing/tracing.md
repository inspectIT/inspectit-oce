This section provides all the information on trace collection with inspectIT Ocelot.

The inspectIT Ocelot configuration has a master switch for tracing, which can be used to completly disable anything that has to do with trace collection and exporting.
Tracing in the agent can be completely disabled by setting the `inspectit.tracing.enabled` property to `false`.
This way any default inspectIT setting or anything else defined for trace collection will be overruled.
If used, the switch makes sure that the inspectIT Ocelot agent:

* disables all trace exporters
* removes tracing from all [instrumentation rules](instrumentation/rules.md)
