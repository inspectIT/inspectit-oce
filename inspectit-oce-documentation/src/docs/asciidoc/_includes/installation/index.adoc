== Installation

This section describes the installation details for the inspectIT OCE agent.

=== Supported Java Runtime Environments

The inspectIT OCE supports Java Runtime Environments in version 1.8.0 and above. You will not be able to use the agent with the lower Java versions.
The agent works with different JRE distributions including Oracle, openJDK, Azul, etc.

=== Adding the Agent to the JVM

The best option for using the inspectIT OCE is to include it to the start of the JVM by using the `-javaagent` command-line option.
This way the agent will be initialized before your application starts.


[subs=attributes+]
```bash
$ java -javaagent:"/path/to/inspectit-oce-agent-{inspectit-oce-version}.jar" -jar my-java-program.jar
```

NOTE: Some application servers have dedicated scripts that are used to launch the actual JVM that runs the application. In such cases, you must alter the start-up scripts in order to instrument the correct JVM.

=== Attaching the Agent to an already started JVM

inspectIT OCE also supports attaching the agent to an already running JVM.
In such a scenario the collection of metrics and traces will start from the point of the attachment.

The attaching can easily be done with utilities like https://github.com/apangin/jattach[jattach]:

[subs=attributes+]
```bash
$ ./jattach.sh <pid> load instrument /path/to/inspectit-oce-agent-{inspectit-oce-version}.jar
```

In order to find the process ID of a running JVM, you can use the `jcmd` to list all the running Java processes on your machine:

```bash
$ jcmd -l
```

WARNING: Using the attach options has some limitations with respect to using the OpenCensus instrumentation library in combination with the inspectIT OCE agent. Please refer to <<Using OpenCensus Library with inspectIT OCE>> section to understand these limitations.
