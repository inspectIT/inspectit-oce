=== inspectIT OCE Demo

If you would like to check inspectIT OCE in action with a demo application, you can use our docker compose example.
We use the distributed version of the https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices[Spring PetClinic sample application] as the target application in our demo.
To demonstrate the flexibility of the OpenCensus bases inspectIT agent, we provide different demo scenarios covering different monitoring and APM components:

All of the demo scenarios are fully configured with predefined dashboards, *so you can get started in 5 minutes*.

==== Launching the Demo

*Pre-requisites:* To launch the demo, https://www.docker.com/[Docker] needs to be installed on your system.


Either https://github.com/inspectIT/inspectit-oce/archive/master.zip[download] or https://github.com/inspectIT/inspectit-oce[clone the inspectit-oce GitHub repository].

Change into the ```inspectit-oce-demo/``` directory and execute the following command to launch the desired demo scenario (replace [SCENARIO_POSTFIX] with the postfix of the scenario you would like to launch):

[subs=attributes+]
```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-[SCENARIO_POSTFIX].yml up
```

This will start all the Docker containers required for the corresponding demo scenario, including the Petclinic demo application.

You can access the demo application (Petclinic) under http://localhost:8080.
Details on accessing monitoring infrastructure components are listed below, depending on the selected demo scenario.


==== Demo Scenarios

===== InfluxDB Scenario
In this scenario the following components are preconfigured and used for monitoring:

image::demo-landscape-influxdb.png[link=https://openapm.io/landscape?agent=inspectit-oce-agent&instrumentation-lib=opencensus&collector=influx-telegraf&storage=influx-db&dashboarding=grafana]

- *inspectIT OCE agent:* Instruments all the target demo application components.
- *InfluxData Telegraf:* Gathers metrics exposed by the agent.
- *InfluxDB:* Stores metric data collected by Telegraf as time series.
- *Grafana:* Provides predefined example Dashboards visualizing the metrics collected by the inspectIT OCE agent. The query language https://docs.influxdata.com/flux[Flux] is used to query the data from InfluxDB.

You can access Grafana through http://localhost:3001 using `admin` as username and `demo` as password.

===== Elastic Scenario
In this scenario the following components are preconfigured and used for monitoring:

image::demo-landscape-elastic.png[link=https://openapm.io/landscape?agent=inspectit-oce-agent&instrumentation-lib=opencensus&collector=influx-telegraf&storage=elasticsearch&visualization=kibana&dashboarding=grafana]

- *inspectIT OCE agent:* Instruments all the target demo application components.
- *InfluxData Telegraf:* Gathers metrics exposed by the agent.
- *Elasticsearch:* Stores metric data collected by Telegraf as time series.
- *Kibana:* Allows to browse the indices from Elasticsearch.
- *Grafana:* Provides predefined example Dashboards visualizing the metrics collected by the inspectIT OCE agent.

You can access Grafana through http://localhost:3001 using `admin` as username and `demo` as password.

Kibana can be accessed through http://localhost:5601.


===== Prometheus Scenario
In this scenario the following components are preconfigured and used for monitoring:

image::demo-landscape-prometheus.png[link=https://openapm.io/landscape?instrumentation-lib=opencensus&agent=inspectit-oce-agent&dashboarding=grafana&collector=prometheus-server]

- *inspectIT OCE agent:* Instruments all the target demo application components.
- *Prometheus Server:* Gathers metrics exposed by the agent.
- *Grafana:* Provides predefined example Dashboards visualizing the metrics collected by the inspectIT OCE agent.

You can access Grafana through http://localhost:3001 using `admin` as username and `demo` as password.

Prometheus can be accessed through http://localhost:9090.

==== Demo Grafana Dashboards
The demo scenarios come with the following predefined Grafana Dashboards:
