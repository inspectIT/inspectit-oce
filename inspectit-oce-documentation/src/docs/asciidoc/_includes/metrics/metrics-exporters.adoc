=== Metrics Exporters

Metrics exporters are responsible for passing the collected metrics to metric storage.
They can implement a push approach where metrics are sent to a collector or a pull approach where metrics are scraped by an external system.

If an exporter supports run-time updates it means that it can be enabled/disabled during the run-time or that any property related to the exporter can be changed.
This way you can, for example, change the endpoint where exporter pushes the metrics without a need to restart the application.
In order to use run-time updates, you must enable one of the <<Externalized Configuration Methods,externalized configuration methods>> that support dynamic updates.

inspectIT OCE current supports following OpenCensus metrics exporters:

==== Prometheus Exporter

Prometheus exporter exposes the metrics in Prometheus format and is the default metrics exporter set up by inspectIT OCE.
It requires that a Prometheus HTTP server is started in parallel with your application.
The server is by default started by the inspectIT OCE agent on port `8888` and metrics can then be accessed by visiting http://localhost:8888/metrics.
