## Changed default data-propagation behaviour

In previous versions data collected in [instrumentation rules](instrumentation/rules.md) could already be used without
explicitly defining it's propagation behaviour under `inspectit.instrumentation.data`. However, in this case the data
would be automatically down-propagated and used as a tag, which comes with a performance penalty.

To avoid unnecessary propagation and usage as tag for e.g. temporary local data, the behaviour had to be explicitly defined:

```yaml
inspectit:
  instrumentation:
    data:
      temp_variable: {down-propagation: NONE, is-tag: false}
```

As these definitions could be easily forgotten, we changed the default behaviour of data:
It now does *not* propagate and is *not* used as a tag automatically. The exception hereby
is (a) if the data is a [common tag](metrics/common-tags.md) or (b) the data is used as a tag in any
[metric definition](metrics/custom-metrics.md). You can still freely override the behaviour by configuring the
settings for your data under `inspectit.instrumentation.data`. For details see the corresponding 
[documentation section](instrumentation/rules.md###Defining the Behaviour).

This is a breaking change because your configurations might not work as expected anymore.
You now have to make sure that for each data, where you expect down-propagation to take place, you add a behaviour definition:

```yaml
inspectit:
  instrumentation:
    data:
      down_propagated_var: {down-propagation: JVM_LOCAL}
```

The change of the `is-tag` setting usually should not affect you, as it automatically picks up tags from the metrics definitions.
