## Changing Capitalization of Self-Monitoring Metric Names

In the current release, the capitalization of the name of the EUM server's self-monitoring metric for counting incoming beacons has been changed.
It was changed from `inspectit-eum_self_beacons_received_COUNT` to `inspectit_eum_self_beacons_received_count`, thus, it consists only of lowercase characters, now.
