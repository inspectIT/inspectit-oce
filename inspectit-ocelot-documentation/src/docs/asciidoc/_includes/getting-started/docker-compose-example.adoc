=== inspectIT Ocelot Demo

If you would like to check inspectIT Ocelot in action with a demo application, you can use our docker compose example.
We use the distributed version of the https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices[Spring PetClinic sample application] as the target application in our demo.
To demonstrate the flexibility of the OpenCensus bases inspectIT agent, we provide different demo scenarios covering different monitoring and APM components:



.Demo Scenarios
|===
|Docker-compose file | Landscape | Description

| docker-compose-influxdb.yml

| Uses InfluxData Telegraf for metrics gathering, InfluxDB for metrics storage and Grafana for Dashboards.

| docker-compose-prometheus.yml
a| image::demo-landscape-prometheus.png[link=https://openapm.io/landscape?instrumentation-lib=opencensus&agent=inspectit-ocelot-agent&dashboarding=grafana&collector=prometheus-server]
| Uses Prometheus Server for metrics gathering and storage, Grafana for Dashboards.

|===

All of the demo scenarios are fully configured with predefined dashboards, *so you can get started in 5 minutes*.

==== Launching the Demo

*Pre-requisites:* To launch the demo, https://www.docker.com/[Docker] needs to be installed on your system.
If you are using Docker for Windows or running Docker in a virtual machine, ensure that Docker has at least 4GB main memory assigned.

Either https://github.com/inspectIT/inspectit-oce/archive/master.zip[download] or https://github.com/inspectIT/inspectit-oce[clone the inspectit-Ocelot GitHub repository].

Change into the ```inspectit-ocelot-demo/``` directory and execute the following command to launch the desired demo scenario (replace [SCENARIO_POSTFIX] with the postfix of the scenario you would like to launch):

[subs=attributes+]
```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-[SCENARIO_POSTFIX].yml up
```

This will start all the Docker containers required for the corresponding demo scenario, including the Petclinic demo application.

You can access the demo application (Petclinic) under http://localhost:8080.
Details on accessing monitoring infrastructure components are listed below, depending on the selected demo scenario.

===== Starting the Demo on Windows Using WSL

If you want to execute the demo on Windows using the Windows subsystem for linux (WSL), you have to mount your hard drive to the WSL's root directory due to a problem of Docker for Windows and its volume mounting.

For example, mounting your C drive to the root file system can be achieved using the following commands:

 sudo mkdir /c
 sudo mount --bind /mnt/c /c

==== Demo Scenarios

===== InfluxDB Scenario
In this scenario the following components are preconfigured and used for monitoring:

image::demo-landscape-influxdb.png[link=https://openapm.io/landscape?agent=inspectit-ocelot-agent&instrumentation-lib=opencensus&collector=influx-telegraf&storage=influx-db&dashboarding=grafana]

- *inspectIT Ocelot agent:* Instruments all the target demo application components.
- *InfluxData Telegraf:* Gathers metrics exposed by the agent.
- *InfluxDB:* Stores metric data collected by Telegraf as time series.
- *Grafana:* Provides predefined example Dashboards visualizing the metrics collected by the inspectIT Ocelot agent. The query language https://docs.influxdata.com/flux[Flux] is used to query the data from InfluxDB.

You can access Grafana through http://localhost:3001 using `admin` as username and `demo` as password.

===== Prometheus Scenario
In this scenario the following components are preconfigured and used for monitoring:

image::demo-landscape-prometheus.png[link=https://openapm.io/landscape?instrumentation-lib=opencensus&agent=inspectit-ocelot-agent&dashboarding=grafana&collector=prometheus-server]

- *inspectIT Ocelot agent:* Instruments all the target demo application components.
- *Prometheus Server:* Gathers metrics exposed by the agent.
- *Grafana:* Provides predefined example Dashboards visualizing the metrics collected by the inspectIT Ocelot agent.

You can access Grafana through http://localhost:3001 using `admin` as username and `demo` as password.

Prometheus can be accessed through http://localhost:9090.

==== Demo Grafana Dashboards
The demo scenarios come with the following predefined Grafana Dashboards:

==== Changing Agent Configurations

In all demo scenarios the inspectIT Ocelot agents already have their service names and used ports as well as a basic instrumentation set up.
However, if you want to customize any other configuration option you can provide custom configuration files.

The demo starts the following services, of which each is instrumented with an inspectIT Ocelot Agent:

- *config-server*
- *discovery-server*
- *customers-service*
- *visits-service*
- *vets-service*
- *api-gateway*

For each service you can put your own agent configuration files in the
correspondingly named subfolders in ```inspectit-ocelot-demo/agentconfig/```.
For example, if you want to change the configuration of the inspectIT Ocelot
agent attached to the *vets-service*, you can put a YAML-file into ```inspectit-ocelot-demo/agentconfig/vets-service```.

Note that it is not required to restart the demo! The agents listen for updates of the corresponding directories and reconfigure themselves when required.
