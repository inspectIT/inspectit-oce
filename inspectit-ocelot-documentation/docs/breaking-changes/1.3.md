## Changed Trace Attributes Behaviour

In previous version it was possible to write [trace attributes](instrumentation/rules.md#adding-attributes)
without actually starting a span in the same method. In this case, attributes would be written to a parent method which was traced.
This could sometimes lead to a surprising behaviour and therefore has been removed.

This behaviour can still be realized if desired via [data propagation](instrumentation/rules.md#data-propagation).

## Reworked Default Agent Configuration

The default configuration of the agent has completely been reworked.

This means that in case your custom instrumentation is based on existing scopes, actions or rules it might stop working.
In order to fix this it is required to adapt your instrumentation to the new default configuration.

## Changed Default Behaviour of the InfluxDB exporter

The InfluxDB metrics exporter has been extended with an optimized handling of counter and sum metrics, which is now the default behaviour.
This new behaviour changes how data is written to InfluxDB, so your existing queries have to be adapted or reworked.

It is still possible to use the previous handling of counters using the exporter's `counters-as-differences` option and setting it to `false`:

    inspectit:
      exporters:
        metrics:
          influx:
            counters-as-differences: false

For more details have a look at the [InfluxDB exporter documentation](metrics/metric-exporters.md#influxdb-exporter).
