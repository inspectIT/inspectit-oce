== Instrumentation

This section describes how the inspectIT Ocelot Java agent is using instrumentation in order to inject sensors and custom code into an application's Java classes and methods.

When we refer to a sensor, this can be seen as a kind of predefined Java code or method that is injected into the target application to execute a certain functionality, such as measuring execution times.
