== Self Monitoring

inspectIT OCE is able to monitor itself and report the time spent in components responsible for recording metrics and creating traces.
This way a user can have a clear view on what is the overhead introduced by running the inspectIT OCE agent.
When self monitoring is enabled, the agent will expose several metrics regarding its internal state and processes.
For example, the `inspectit/self/duration` metric gives the total execution time spent in the agent in microseconds.
All metrics include the configured <<Common Tags, common tags>>.
The metric is split by the tag containing the component name and also includes all common tags.

Self monitoring is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the `inspectit.self-monitoring.enabled` property to `true`.

WARNING: Components responsible for internal management of inspectIT OCE are at the moment not reporting the time used for internal tasks. Please take the provided numbers only for a basic reference on overhead and don't assume they are 100% correct.
