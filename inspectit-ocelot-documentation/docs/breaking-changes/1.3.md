## Changed Trace Attributes Behaviour

In previous version it was possible to write [trace attributes](instrumentation/rules.md#adding-attributes)
without actually starting a span in the same method. In this case, attributes would be written to a parent method which was traced.
This could sometimes lead to a surprising behaviour and therefore has been removed.

This behaviour can still be realized if desired via [data propagation](instrumentation/rules.md#data-propagation).
