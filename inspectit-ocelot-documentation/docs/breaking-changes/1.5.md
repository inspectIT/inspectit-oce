## Regex Replacement in the EUM-Server

In the previous versions, it was possible to specify derived tags in the EUM-Server based
on a single regular expression extraction:

```YAML
inspectit-eum-server:
  tags:
    beacon:
      URL_USER_ERASED: 
        input: u
        regex: "\\/user\\/\d+"
        replacement: "\\/user\\/{id}"
        keep-no-match: true
```

This configuration uses of the tag value `u`, replaces all user-IDs and stores the result in the tag `URL_USER_ERASED`.
While for backwards compatibility reasons this approach still is functional, it has been deprecated in favor of the new syntax:

```YAML
inspectit-eum-server:
  tags:
    beacon:
      URL_USER_ERASED: 
        input: u
        replacements:
         -  regex: "\\/user\\/\d+"
            replacement: "\\/user\\/{id}"
            keep-no-match: true
```

This new syntax allows to specify a list of regular expressions to apply instead of a single one.
The EUM-Server will process all regular expressions in their order and will replace all matches within the input tag.
The `keep-no-match` property defines how to behave in case no match is found in the source tag for a given regex.
If `keep-no-match` is `false`, no tag value will be output in this case. If it is `true`, 
the previous value will be used without performing any replacements.
Hereby the default value of `keep-no-match` has changed: it is now `true` instead of `false`.
