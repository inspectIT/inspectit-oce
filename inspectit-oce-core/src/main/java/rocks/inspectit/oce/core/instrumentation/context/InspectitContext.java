/**
 * This class allows the storage and configurable up and down propagation of data.
 * An inspectIT context has four lifecycle phases which correspond to the phased of hooks added to methods:
 * <p>
 * Executed Method:   | <- entry hook -> | <- method body  -> | <- exit hook -> | (method has returned)
 * Context Lifecycle: | <- Entry Phase-> | <- Active Phase -> | <- Exit Phase-> |  (Closed)
 * <p>
 * When a method is entered, the entry hook is executed.
 * In this phase a new InspectitContext is created but not yet made active.
 * This context inherits all down-propagated data from the currently active context as well as all tags from the active TagContext.
 * In the entry phase, the contexts data can be altered via {@link #setData(String, Object)}, even though the context is not yet active.
 * <p>
 * When {@link #makeActive()} is called, the current context transitions from the "Entry" to the "Active" state.
 * This means that the data the context stores is now immutable and also published as TagContext.
 * In addition, the context now replaces its parent in GRPC, so that all newly created contexts will be children of this one.
 * There is one exception to the data immutability: child contexts perform the data up-propagation during this contexts active phase.
 * <p>
 * All synchronous child contexts are opened and closed during the "active" phase of their parent.
 * When such a child context is closed, it writes the up-propagated data it changed to the parent by calling {@link #performUpPropagation(Map)}.
 * Note that this only happens if the child context is synchronous, no up-propagation is performed for asynchronous children!
 * <p>
 * The up-propagation does not have an effect on the tag-context opened by the parent during the "active" phase.
 * E.g. if a child adds or overwrites a value its parent through up-propagation, this new value will not be visible in the tag context.
 * However, as soon as a new, synchronous child context of the parent is created and it opens a tag context, the changes wil lbe visible in the new context
 * <p>
 * When data is configured to be both up and down propagated, the down propagated data depends on whether the child is synchronous or not.
 * Consider a simple example where the context "parent" has two children "firstChild" and "secondChild" which are executed after each other.
 * This means that "firstChild" performs its up-propagation before "secondChild" is created and enters the "Entry" phase.
 * If "secondChild" is synchronous, it will now inherit the changed data which was up-propagated by "firstChild".
 * If "secondChild" however is asynchronous, it will only see the data of "parent" how it was at the end of the "Entry" phase.
 * In this case, the up-propagation done by "firstChild" will be invisible for "secondChild".
 * This behaviour was chosen to prevent potential race conditions for asynchronous contexts.
 *
 * <p>
 * Finally the context will enter the "Exit" phase after its method has terminated.
 * At this point, all synchronous child contexts have been created and closed, meaning that their values have been up-propagated.
 * During the exit phase, the contexts data can be modified again.
 * Note again that for any asynchronous child at any point of time the parent data will be visible as it was after the parents entry phase.
 * <p>
 * As noted previously the tag context opened by the context at the end of its entry phase will be stale for teh exit phase:
 * It does not contain any up-propagated data, neither does it contain any changes performed during the exit phase.
 * For this reason, an up-to-date tag context can be acquired using {@link #enterFullTagScope()} within which then metrics can be collected.
 * <p>
 * Finally a context finishes the exit phase with a call to {@link #close()}
 * If the context is synchronous, it will perform its up-propagation.
 * In addition ,the tag-context opened by the call to makeActive will be closed and the
 * previous parent will be registered back in GRPC as active context.
