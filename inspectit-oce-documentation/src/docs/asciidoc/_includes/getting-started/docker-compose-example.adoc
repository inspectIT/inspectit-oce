=== inspectIT OCE Demo

If you would like to check inspectIT OCE in action with a demo application, you can use our docker compose example.
We use the distributed version of the https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-petclinic-microservices[Spring PetClinic sample application] as the target application in our demo.
To demonstrate the flexibility of the OpenCensus bases inspectIT agent, we provide different demo scenarios covering different monitoring and APM components:

| Uses InfluxData Telegraf for metrics gathering, Elasticsearch for metrics storage, Kibana and Grafana for visualization and Dashboards.

All of the demo scenarios are fully configured with predefined dashboards, *so you can get started in 5 minutes*.

==== Launching the Demo

*Pre-requisites:* To launch the demo, https://www.docker.com/[Docker] needs to be installed on your system.


Either https://github.com/inspectIT/inspectit-oce/archive/master.zip[download] or https://github.com/inspectIT/inspectit-oce[clone the inspectit-oce GitHub repository].

Change into the ```inspectit-oce-demo/``` directory and execute the following command to launch the desired demo scenario (replace [SCENARIO_POSTFIX] with the postfix of the scenario you would like to launch):

[subs=attributes+]
```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose-[SCENARIO_POSTFIX].yml up
```

This will start all the Docker containers required for the corresponding demo scenario, including the Petclinic demo application.

You can access the demo application (Petclinic) under http://localhost:8080.
Details on accessing monitoring infrastructure components are listed below, depending on the selected demo scenario.


==== Demo Scenarios

===== InfluxDB Scenario
In this scenario the following components are preconfigured and used for monitoring:

image::demo-landscape-influxdb.png[link=https://openapm.io/landscape?agent=inspectit-oce-agent&instrumentation-lib=opencensus&collector=influx-telegraf&storage=influx-db&dashboarding=grafana]

- *inspectIT OCE agent:* Instruments all the target demo application components.
- *InfluxData Telegraf:* Gathers metrics exposed by the agent.
- *InfluxDB:* Stores metric data collected by Telegraf as time series.
- *Grafana:* Provides predefined example Dashboards visualizing the metrics collected by the inspectIT OCE agent. The query language https://docs.influxdata.com/flux[Flux] is used to query the data from InfluxDB.

You can access Grafana through http://localhost:3001 using `admin` as username and `demo` as password.

===== Elastic Scenario
In this scenario the following components are preconfigured and used for monitoring:

image::demo-landscape-elastic.png[link=https://openapm.io/landscape?agent=inspectit-oce-agent&instrumentation-lib=opencensus&collector=influx-telegraf&storage=elasticsearch&visualization=kibana&dashboarding=grafana]

- *inspectIT OCE agent:* Instruments all the target demo application components.
- *InfluxData Telegraf:* Gathers metrics exposed by the agent.
- *Elasticsearch:* Stores metric data collected by Telegraf as time series.
- *Kibana:* Allows to browse the indices from Elasticsearch.
- *Grafana:* Provides predefined example Dashboards visualizing the metrics collected by the inspectIT OCE agent.

You can access Grafana through http://localhost:3001 using `admin` as username and `demo` as password.

Kibana can be accessed through http://localhost:5601.


===== Prometheus Scenario
In this scenario the following components are preconfigured and used for monitoring:

image::demo-landscape-prometheus.png[link=https://openapm.io/landscape?instrumentation-lib=opencensus&agent=inspectit-oce-agent&dashboarding=grafana&collector=prometheus-server]

- *inspectIT OCE agent:* Instruments all the target demo application components.
- *Prometheus Server:* Gathers metrics exposed by the agent.
- *Grafana:* Provides predefined example Dashboards visualizing the metrics collected by the inspectIT OCE agent.

You can access Grafana through http://localhost:3001 using `admin` as username and `demo` as password.

Prometheus can be accessed through http://localhost:9090.

==== Demo Grafana Dashboards
The demo scenarios come with the following predefined Grafana Dashboards:

==== Changing Agent Configurations

In all demo scenarios the inspectIT OCE agents already have their service names and used ports set up.
However, if you want to customize any other configuration option you can provide custom configuration files.

The demo starts the following services, of which each is instrumented with an inspectIT OCE Agent:

- *config-server*
- *discovery-server*
- *customers-service*
- *visits-service*
- *vets-service*
- *api-gateway*

For each service you can put your own agent configuration files in the
correspondingly named subfolders in ```inspectit-oce-demo/agentconfig/```.
For example, if you want to change the configuration of the inspectIT OCE
agent attached to the *vets-service*, you can put a YAML-file into ```inspectit-oce-demo/agentconfig/vets-service```.

Note that it is not required to restart the demo! The agents listen for updates of the corresponding directories and reconfigure themselves when required.
